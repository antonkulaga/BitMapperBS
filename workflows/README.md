Example WDL workflows
---------------------

At workflows folder, we put example WDL workflows to build an index and do mapping with Bitmapper. 
WDL is a workflow description language developed by the Broad Institute. 
To run it you need [Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell) or any other workflows engine that supports.
We also put example input json that should be modified according to the locations of files/folders that you have at your machine. 
If you use Cromwell to run WDL, you can also try [Cromwell-Client](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell) that provides a helpful user interface for it.
